# Pointifai
## A pointless game for pointless people

A game created for BrumHack 3.0, part of the MLH EU Fall 2015 season. The game combines the (http://clarifai.com/)[Clarifai API] and (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless_(game_show))[Pointless], so players can compete against each other to guess the most obscure tag that Clarifai returns for an image.
